# Factorial Calculation

## Problem Statement
This program demonstrates how to calculate the `factorial` of a number using a method in Java. The `factorial()` method uses a loop to compute the factorial value. In the main method, an object of the `MATH` class is created and the factorial of 5 is calculated and displayed.

## Output

The program should output number `120` when the input is `5`.

## Problem Solution

Go to [MATH.java](https://github.com/With-ALIF/Solving_Java/blob/main/Phase-01/Problem-02/MATH.java) for the  solution code.

# Parameterized Constructor 

## Problem Statement
This program shows the use of a `parameterized constructor`. The constructor of class C initializes the variable value. The main method creates an object of class C and prints the value.

## Output 
The  Output : `5.0`

## Problem Solution

Go to [showErrorD.java](https://github.com/With-ALIF/Solving_Java/blob/main/Phase-01/Problem-02/showErrorD.java) for the  solution code.

# Use of Inner Class and Method 

## Problem Statement
This program demonstrates the use of an inner class in Java. The class `Circle` is defined inside the `showErrors` class and contains a constructor and a method to calculate the area of a circle. In `method1()`, an object of the inner class is created and its `getArea()` method is called. The `main` method creates an object of `showErrors` and invokes `method1()`.

## Output
Area: 78.539816.......

## Problem Solution 

Go to [showErrors.java](https://github.com/With-ALIF/Solving_Java/blob/main/Phase-01/Problem-02/showErrors.java) for the  solution code.


# Use of Constructor and Method in Java

## Problem Statement
This program demonstrates the use of a parameterized constructor and an instance method. The constructor of class `A` initializes the variable `s`. The `print()` method displays the value of s. In the main method, an object of class A is created and the `print()` method is called.

## Output:
String: 10

## Problem solution
Go to [Test.java](https://github.com/With-ALIF/Solving_Java/blob/main/Phase-01/Problem-02/Test.java) for the  solution code.
